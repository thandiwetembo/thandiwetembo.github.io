    <p class="sectionCopy">TUUN is a web application in which users receive algorithmically curated playlists

    <p class="sectionTitle">02 | OPPORTUNITY STATEMENT</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy"> <span class="accentText">Spotify’s Mission:</span> to unlock the potential of human
      creativity—by giving a million creative artists
      the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.
      <br><br>
      <span class="accentText">With over 80 million tracks on Spotify, the process of finding new music and curating
        personalized playlist can be over
        whelming to users. There is an opportunity to provide users with algorithmically curated playlist based on
        unexplored properties.</span>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">03 | SOLUTION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy"> Inspired by popular web apps like <a href="https://discoverquickly.com/">Discover
        Quickly</a>, <a href="https://musicscapes.herokuapp.com/">MusicScapes</a>, and <a
        href="https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/index.html">Receiptify</a>, TUUN created a web application in which users
      could take a quiz to map their music to color associations, create a custom color palette and receive a playlist
      based on the color mapping and color palette. A product like this not only helps further explore the psychological
      connections between color and music, but could also be used to aid lighting design for live events, in
      partnerships with smart light bulbs/ companies and more.

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">04 | DISCOVER & SYNTHESIZE</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">The discovery phase of developing a this product had 3 elements:
      <br> <span class="accentText">Research, Survey, and a Competitive Analysis. </span>
      <br> <br> We initially theorize that there is a unique association people have between music and color and emotion
      might be a connector for that association. In analyzing the results of our research, we not only validated that
      building an experience around
      color, music, and emotion
      would result in a personalized experience & playlists but also that there was a substantial number
      of possible users, a space for it in the music experience market.

      <p class="subsectionTitle">Research</p>
      <div class="sectionCopy">
        <span class="accentText">Spotify</span> <br><br>
        The music platform of choice was Spotify because they have the largest portion of the global music streaming
        market at 31% with 365
        million monthly active users according to their Q2 2021 report.
        <br> <br>

        <span class="accentText">Music, Color, Emotion</span> <br><br>
        We decided to design the experience around the color. We suspected peoples taste and connection to music is not
        fully universal and quite unique to the individual. Additionally, we know that music can evoke certain emotions
        and wanted to
        use emotion as the middle man between music and color because color can also evoke and relate to emotions.
        All songs on Spotify are given a “valence” metric or a metic that describes “the musical positiveness conveyed
        by
        a track” and this would be the metric used to make the emotion link.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="subsectionSection">
      <p class="subsectionTitle">Competitive Analysis</p>
      <div class="sectionCopy">
        A competitive analysis was done to understand how new experiences were being created using Spotify.
        We saw that there were tons of products that created custom playlists based on ones Spotify library and
        product that specifically used color and emotion to do that but none that used both music and color
        indicating a possible space in the market for our product.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="subsectionSection">
      <p class="subsectionTitle">Survey</p>
      <div class="sectionCopy">
        <span class="accentText">The goal was to see:</span> <br><br>
        ↳ How do people associate music to color (and is emotion a connecter between the two)? <br><br>
        ↳ Are those associations unique or universal? <br><br>
        ↳ Can these connections be used to produce a novel music discovery experience? <br><br>

        <span class="accentText">Our most notable findings were:</span> <br><br>

        ↳ Users associated certain colors with certain moods/emotions and those connections were often related to
        culture, childhood, experiences, memories or a certain mood/vibe<br><br>
        ↳Users connected the same artist to different colors & same the color to artists in genres, suggesting a
        possibility of unique or personalized color-music associations <br><br>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">05 | IDEATION & ITERATION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">
      Our ideation and interactions phase confirmed that we wanted to focus on a mobile first design process because most
      users use Spotify and other potentially related applications like Instagram on their mobile devices. Additionally, we conducted
      several rounds of group design critiques, users testing, and user presentations and feedback sessions leading up to our final product.
    </p>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">06 | FINAL PRODUCT</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">
      The final site consisted of the calibration section and playlist section of the experience. Users would take the calibration
    quiz to map their music-color associations, then create a color palette(s) and would produce a custom playlist</p>
    <br><br>

    <div class="gridLayout">
      <div class="subsectionSection">
        <img class="finalImage" src="/imagesAndIcons/TUUN/TUUN_final_.png"></img>
    </div>

      <p class="sectionCopy"><span class="accentText">Due to time constraints, only the main calibration portion of the
          experience was extensively tested, however future testing would
          include: </span><br><br>
        ↳ Test the overall experience with a broader demographic of users and to collect user data for the analysis
        portion
        of the site <br><br>
        ↳ Design and develop the music-color data analysis section of the site<br><br>
        ↳ Testing with people who do experience color blindness and synesthesia

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">07 | REFLECTION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">My biggest takeaways from this project was that it was a great exposure to working with
      established design system and guidelines. While we did establish our own branding for TUUN, because we were
      working with
      Spotify's API, we needed to diligently adhere to their design guidelines. It was a good exercise in working with
      developers and creating a product
      from concept to launch. Additionally, because we were establishing a new product, it provided an opportunity
      to explore what possible applications, profit opportunities, and measures of impact the product could have.

      <br><br><br>
      <span class="accentText">MEASURING IMPACT & PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES</span><br><br>
      ↳ Use user satisfaction survey to the gauge overall response of the experience<br><br>
      ↳ Tracking palette-playlist creations and palette-playlist saves to see if people are coming back to the
      experience<br><br>
      ↳ Given that people are repeat users of the experience, place certain palette-playlist creation features
      behind a paywall (only 3 free playlist and pay to create more)<br><br>
      ↳ Use the data collected from the experience and the information from analyzing users' color-music connections and
      trends to make data-driven lighting design decisions for physical experiences (concerts, bar/clubs, interactive
      experience/installations)
