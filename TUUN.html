            Being given an open ended prompt allows for a lot of freedom but also little direction. 
            <br><br>
            Collaborative brainstorming led us to start thinking about discovery and experiences with music and digital community. 
            We concluded that we wanted to create a digital personalized music discovery experience for Spotify users and help users 
            discover new music.</p>

                      <span class="accentText">Spotify</span> <br><br>
                      The music platform of choice was Spotify because they have 31% of the global music streaming market in 2021 and 365 
                      million monthly active users according to their Q2 2021 report. Additionally, it is a platform that the team knew well 
                      and access to testing participants and potential users would be abundant.

                      <span class="accentText">Music, Color, Emotion</span> <br><br>
                      We decided to design the experience around the color. We knew peoples taste and connection to music is not 
                      universal and often unique to the individual. Additionally, we know that music can evoke certain emotions and wanted to 
                      use emotion as the middle man between music and color because color can also evoke and relate to emotions. Additionally, 
                      all songs on Spotify are given a “valence” metric or a metic that describes “the musical positiveness conveyed by 
                      a track” and this would be a key in the backend of our experience.

                      ↳ Users commonly associated certain colors with certain moods/emotions (often falling in line with color psychology) <br><br>
                      ↳ Users often connected their favorite color and favorite artists to album cover art & emotion<br><br>
                      ↳ Connections between color and emotion were often related to Culture/Childhood/Experiences/Memories

                      ↳ Users connected the same artist to different colors & same the color to artists in genres, suggesting a

                      A competitive analysis was done to understand how new experiences were being created using Spotify. 
                      We saw that there were tons of products that created custom playlists based on ones Spotify library and 
                      product that specifically used color and emotion to do that but none that used both music and color 
                      indicating a possible space in the market for our product.
