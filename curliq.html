    <p class="sectionTitle">01 | TLDR;</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">Curl IQ is a technology company revolutionizing the future of Black, Natural/Textured hair. 
      With their technology, one picture can tell you how to care for your hair, recreate a hairstyle and so much more.
      This project, an extension of Curl IQ's brand manifesto video and with the help of 
      <a href="https://www.manurevastudio.com/" target="_blank">Manureva Studio</a>, was the start to end conceptualization, design 
      and development of brand merchandized that emphasized the message that hair is revolutionary.

    <p class="sectionTitle">02 | CONCEPT</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy"> <b>Black Hair is not just hair.</b>
      <br><br>
      Hair is often dismissed as superficial. But so most times, it's a reflection of how you feel, how
      you want to be seen, and how you see yourself. Our hair is capricious and dynamic. It's a tool
      that we use to love and learn about ourselves. It's our great equalizer. Our bonding moment. No
      matter what age you are, what socioeconomic background you come from, your religion, sexual
      orientation, or gender identity, it extends a unique invitation for the community, connection,
      self-expression, and self-appreciation!
      <br><br>
      You can compliment a haircut and in minutes end up
      learning about someone's heartbreak, or remark on a shade of hair color and somehow land on
      a discussion about politics. To know your hair is empowering, expressive, and exciting. Hair
      texture is as versatile and unique as each one of us. Our hair is ours to style and express how
      we see fit. Hair is not just what grows out of our head. It is, has been and will always be so much
      more. This collection of merchandise reflects this meaning and the messages that our hair is the catalyst 
      for revolution.
