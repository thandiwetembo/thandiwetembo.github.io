            <br><br>
            Collaborative brainstorming led us to start thinking about discovery and experiences with music and digital community. 
            We concluded that we wanted to create a digital personalized music discovery experience for Spotify users and help users 
            discover new music.</p>

                      <span class="accentText">Spotify</span> <br><br>
                      The music platform of choice was Spotify because they have the largest portion of the global music streaming market at 31% with 365 
                      million monthly active users according to their Q2 2021 report.

                      We decided to design the experience around the color. We suspected peoples taste and connection to music is not 
                      fully universal and quite unique to the individual. Additionally, we know that music can evoke certain emotions and wanted to 
                      use emotion as the middle man between music and color because color can also evoke and relate to emotions. 
                      All songs on Spotify are given a “valence” metric or a metic that describes “the musical positiveness conveyed by 
                      a track” and this would be the metric used to make the emotion link.

                      A competitive analysis was done to understand how new experiences were being created using Spotify. 
                      We saw that there were tons of products that created custom playlists based on ones Spotify library and 
                      product that specifically used color and emotion to do that but none that used both music and color 
                      indicating a possible space in the market for our product.

                      ↳  How do people associate music to color (and is emotion a connecter between the two)? <br><br>
                      ↳  Are those associations unique or universal? <br><br>
                      ↳  Can these connections be used to produce a novel music discovery experience? <br><br>

                      <span class="accentText">Our most notable findings were:</span> <br><br>

                      ↳ Users associated certain colors with certain moods/emotions and those connections were often related to 
                      culture, childhood, experiences, memories or a certain mood/vibe<br><br>
                      ↳Users connected the same artist to different colors & same the color to artists in genres, suggesting a 
                      possibility of unique or personalized color-music associations <br><br>

              At this point we decided that user would take a “quiz” that would map their color to music or valence metric 
              associations. They could then create a color pallet that would generate a playlist in which the songs 
              correspond to one of the chosen colors.</p>

              <p class="picTextLayout">Our information architecture was used to determine who would design which section of the experience. 
              From this point, I focused on designing the playlist and web player portion of the site. These original sketches

                After several rounds of design critiques, we decided the final web application would be designed for mobile. 
                This is because, while the application is not restricted to one device, we operated under the assumption that
                most users and testers use and log into Spotify primarily on their phones. This is important when considering the 
                authentication step of the experience which is required when using the API.

              My final designs within the experience featured the color palette associated with the created playlist,

              featuring the color associated with the song playing.</p>

          <p class="sectionCopy">My biggest takeaways from this project was that it was a great exposure to working with 
            established design system and guidelines. While we did establish our own branding for TUUN, because we were working with
            Spotify's API, we needed to diligently adhere to their design guidelines. It was a good exercise in working with developers and creating a product 
            from concept to launch.  Additionally, because we were establishing a new product, it provided an opportunity 
            to explore what possible applications, profit opportunities, and measures of impact the product could have.

              <span class="accentText">MEASURING IMPACT & PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES</span><br><br>
              ↳ Use user satisfaction survey to the gauge overall response of the experience<br><br>
              ↳ Tracking palette-playlist creations and palette-playlist saves to see if people are coming back to the experience<br><br>
              ↳ Given that people are repeat users of the experience, place certain palette-playlist creation features
              behind a paywall (only 3 free playlist and pay to create more)<br><br>
              ↳ Use the data collected from the experience and the information from analyzing users' color-music connections and 
              trends to make data-driven lighting design decisions for physical experiences (concerts, bar/clubs, interactive 
              experience/installations)
