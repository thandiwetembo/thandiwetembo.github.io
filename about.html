  <p class="copyText">
    I entered college thinking I would exit a software developer. Declaring a combined degree in Computer Science and Design, 
    I wanted to nurture my analytical problem-solving skills and my creative passion, expanding both my right and left brain. 
    Additionally, declaring a minor in Criminal Justice to learn more about people. Weirdly enough, this combination is the 
    reason I exited university confident in becoming a UX Designer. Combining creative, analytical, and empathetic problem 
    solving provided me with the foundation of what UX Designers do. It fostered my curiosity to analyze and enhance products 
    and systems, my passion for collaborating with others on new challenges, and my excitement to understand and empathize with 
    others and produce accessible and inclusive design that enhances the human experience and reflects the future of our society.

    <br><br>

    Design is my chosen tool to achieve meaningful change, connection & community. <br> I advocate for inclusive and
    accessible design that reflects embraces the diversity within society.

    <br><br>

    When I'm not fully immersed in the art & design world, you'll probably find me baking, cooking, weightlifting, or wandering around an art museums

    <br><br><br>

    But who am I really? Maybe my current Top 5 Tracks says it all: <br><br>
    ↳ Happiness by The 1975 | the best band of all time <br>
    ↳ Heat Above by Greta Van Fleet | 70s inspired ethereal beauty <br>
    ↳ Horchata by Vampire Weekend | Fall is coming. <br>
    ↳ Fall by The Cavemen. | Afro-Indie vibes <br>
    ↳ Chaise Longue by Wet Leg | A bop. A banger. A beast. <br>
