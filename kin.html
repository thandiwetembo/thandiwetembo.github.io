    <p class="sectionTitle">01 | SUMMARY</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">Kin Kitchen is the product of a 12-hour solo design challenge in which I was tasked to design
      a cooking app for friends and family who do not reside together. Using the app, friends and family can share,
      follow along to a recipe and cook a meal together, allowing kinfolk and chosen families of all kinds to bond while
      they are physically apart.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">02 | OPPORTUNITY STATEMENT</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">
      With people living more isolated, away from friends and family, people are looking for a new way to bond
      virtually. Now days, you might need cookbooks, mobile apps and other devices in order to virtually share a meal
      with someone. There is an opportunity to consolidate this community-based cooking experience in to one place,
      helping people find, share, and cook recipes all on their phone.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">03 | SOLUTION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy"> The final prototype features a database of recipes for used to select from, the ability to
      send and share that recipe with other user contacts on the application as well as in-app video call capabilities
      where users can follow along with the recipe while on the call.</p>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">04 | RESEARCH</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">The first step of this project was to investigate how this design challenge might be solved
      with existing products, then define the target customer to inform user aptitude and any usability features to keep
      in mind, then determine what key tasks users should be able complete on the application. I wanted to keep in mind
      that there would be some element of multitasking when it came to using the application and wanted to keep in mind
      what that looked like with current solutions. The results of the research indicated that there weren’t a lot of
      simple multitasking options and technological aptitude and simplicity would be important themes to keep in mind
      moving forward.

      <br><br><br>

      <span class="subsectionTitle">Competitive Analysis</span>

      <br><br>
      To better understand my problem and possible solutions, I examined what options users already have to cook
      remotely with friends & family. This competitive analysis examined a few current product solutions' strengths and
      shortcomings.

      <br><br><br>

      <span class="subsectionTitle">Defining the Costumer</span>
      <br><br>
      The research and problem description helped establish who would be using the application. Being able to cook with
      friends and family members implied the possibility of a range of user ages. This variety in age also implied the
      possibility of a large variety in technology conformability and cooking skills. As a result, user personas were
      created and
      a key goal for the application was to make completing the key task as simple and straightforward as possible.
      <br><br><br>

      <span class="subsectionTitle">Identified Main User Tasks</span>
      <br><br>
      The previous research set up a solid foundation for the final product. By establishing how these products could be
      used to solve the problem at hand and who potential customers might be, I was able to determine what tasks users
      need be able to complete and what features those tasks might need.
      <br><br>
      The main goal of the app is to allow users to cook meals with family remotely. The ability to virtually connect
      with and view/share recipes with callers were some of the most important tasks users should be able to
      complete. In order for the user to complete these tasks, they needed to be able to do other things like search for
      recipes, view recipes and call other users. Establishing the user's tasks then lent itself to establishing the
      user flow of the application.
      <br><br>
      ↳ User Task 1: View and select recipes from a collection <br><br>
      ↳ User Task 2: Voice or video call user in application <br><br>
      ↳ User Task 3: Follow along with recipe while on the call <br><br>
    </p>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">05 | PLANNING</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">
      Once the research and planning were complete, user flows and wireframes were drawn out. A simple user flow was
      created to
      determine how certain features and tasks would connect. This then informed the following wireframes that set the
      foundation
      for the final screens

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">06 | FINAL REDESIGN</p>
    <p class="sectionCopyPrototype">
      The final prototypes shows a landing page after the user logs in. They can then view a data base of recipes. Once
      they select and view a recipe, they can call another user, thus sharing that recipe and cook with them via video
      call, viewing reach step of the recipe one by one as well as gauge where their cooking buddy is in the cooking
      process.

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">07 | REFLECTION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">Given the time constraints of the project, things like testing and user research weren’t able
      to happen. I would have liked to do initial user interviews to see what tasks people would have liked to be able
      to do just based on hearing the idea of the application. I would also liked to test the first version of the
      prototype to see gauge the effectiveness of this solutions.
      <br><br>
      Additionally, I think an application like this could have other applications and partnerships like with mobile
      dating apps and with meal kit services.
