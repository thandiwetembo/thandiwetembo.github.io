  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">01 | SUMMARY</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">Kin Kitchen is the product of a 12-hour solo design challenge in which I was tasked to design
      a cooking app for friends and family who do not reside together. Using the app, friends and family can share,
      follow along with a recipe and cook a meal together, allowing kinfolk and chosen families of all kinds to bond
      while
      they are physically apart.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">02 | OPPORTUNITY STATEMENT</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">
      With people living more isolated, and away from friends and family, people are looking for a new way to bond
      virtually. Nowadays, you might need cookbooks, mobile apps, and other devices to virtually share a meal
      with someone. There is an opportunity to consolidate this community-based cooking experience into one place,
      helping people find, share, and cook recipes all on their phones.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">03 | SOLUTION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy"> The final prototype features a database of recipes for users to select from, the ability to
      send and share that recipe with other user contacts on the application as well as in-app video call capabilities
      where users can follow along with the recipe while on the call.</p>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">04 | RESEARCH</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">The first step of this project was to investigate how this design challenge might be solved
      with existing products, then define the target customer to inform user aptitude and any usability features to keep
      in mind, then determine what key tasks users should be able complete on the application.
      <br><br>
      <b>The time constraint did not allow for research like user interviews. While interviews would have been useful to
        see what users might be currently using as solutions to this problem and also help inform a competitive
        analysis, the competitive analysis would still give perspective on the pros and cons of current solutions. </b>
      <br><br>
      Additionally, I assumed that there would be some level of multitasking when it came to using the application and
      wanted to keep in mind what that looked like with current solutions.
      <br><br>
      The results of the research indicated that there are products that could currently be used to address this problem
      but there wasn't a simple one-stop multitasking option. Additionally, technological aptitude and simplicity would
      be important themes to keep in mind moving forward.

      <br><br><br>

      <span class="subsectionTitle">Competitive Analysis</span>

      <br><br>
      To better understand my problem and possible solutions, I examined what options users already have to cook
      remotely with friends & family. This competitive analysis examined a few current product solutions' strengths and
      shortcomings.

      <img class="caseImage" src="/imagesAndIcons/KIN/KinKitchen_CA_.png"></img>

      <br><br><br>

      <span class="subsectionTitle">Defining the Costumer</span>
      <br><br>
      The research and problem description helped establish who would be using the application. <b>This was important to
      establish in order to determine and understand the applications usability, accessability and task complexity.</b>
      Being able to cook with friends and family members implied the possibility of a range of user ages. This variety in 
      age also implied the possibility of a large variety in technology conformability and cooking skills. As a result, 
      a goal moving forward was to make the process of completing tasks on the application as straightforward and straightforward 
      as possible.
      <br><br><br>

      <span class="subsectionTitle">Identified Main User Tasks</span>
      <br><br>
      By establishing how existing products could be used to solve the problem and who potential customers might be, I
      was able to determine what tasks users need be able to complete and what features those tasks might need.
      <br><br>
      <b>The main goal of the app is to allow users to cook meals with family remotely. The ability to virtually connect
      with and view/share recipes with callers were some of the most important tasks users should be able to
      complete. For the user to complete these tasks, they needed to be able to do other things like search for
      recipes, view recipes, and call other users. Establishing the user's tasks then lent itself to establishing the
      user flow of the application.</b>
      <br><br>
      ↳ User Task 1: View and select recipes from a collection <br><br>
      ↳ User Task 2: Voice or video call user in application <br><br>
      ↳ User Task 3: Follow along with the recipe while on the call <br><br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">05 | PLANNING</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">
      Once the research and planning were complete, user flows and wireframes were drawn out. A simple user flow was
      created to
      determine how certain features and tasks would connect. This then informed the following wireframes that set the
      foundation
      for the final screens

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">06 | FINAL REDESIGN</p>
    <p class="sectionCopyPrototype">
      The final prototype shows a landing page after the user logs in. They can then view a database of recipes <b> that visually 
      is displayed in a modular grid style like on an e-commerce site giving users a sense of familiarity in item displays and allowing
      everyone on the application to view the same recipes</b>. Once they select and view a recipe, they can call another user, 
      thus sharing that recipe with them, <b>eliminating any back and forth between outside messaging application that might be used to 
      share a recipe and ensuring they are viewing the same recipe.</b> Lastly, they can cook with them via video call on the app, viewing 
      each step of the recipe one by one <b>to reduce information overload from viewing the whole recipe at once.</b> While cooking, users hit 
      the check box to indicate they have completed the visible step. This <b>allows users to gauge where their cooking buddy is in the 
      cooking process and once both parties have completed the visible step, the next step will be provided to make sure they are 
      cooking at the same pace.</b>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">07 | REFLECTION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">Given the time constraints of the project, things like testing and user research weren’t able
      to happen. I would have liked to do initial user interviews to see what tasks people would have liked to be able
      to do just based on hearing the idea of the application. I would also like to test the first version of the
      prototype to see test the effectiveness of this solution.
      <br><br>
      Additionally, I think an application like this could have other applications and partnerships like mobile
      dating apps and meal kit service companies.
