    <p class="sectionTitle">01 | SUMMARY</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">NUGo is an application for Northeastern students where they can view student information like
      class schedules, husky dollars, grades and more. This project focused on adding and redesign of the dining
      section of the application application.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">02 | PROBLEM</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">
      Northeastern students feel confused about how and where they can use their Husky Card. They must navigate thought
      multiple sites and sections of the Northeastern Dining websites to find accurate Husky Card Services information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="caseStudySection">
    <p class="sectionTitle">03 | SOLUTION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy"> Expanding the Husky Card section on the NUGO app that allows students to access information
      their Husky Dollars, Dining Dollars, meal swipes, and dining locations. Students have access to maps and lists
      that display where individuals can use their dining swipes and credits. Additionally, Students can receive
      notification of updates, changes and alterations related to Husky Card Services.</p>

    <p class="sectionTitle">04 | RESEARCH</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">Initially, we started by brainstorming what exactly we felt was the problems with the NUGO
      application specifically in regard to the husky card services. We completed an audit of app and websites needed to
      currently of find out Husky Card Service information and used our findings from the audit to inform our
      user interviews. Before the interviews we were focused on simplifying the process of finding vendor
      information. After the interviews, users brought forth other related issues like updating card balances
      and being informed out outages and vendor changes.

      <br><br><br>

      <span class="subsectionTitle">Application Audit | Key Findings</span>

      <br><br>

      ↳ Mobile application only has Husky Card and Meal Plan balance <br><br>
      ↳ Mobile application has a list of on and off campus Northeastern buildings but no map, navigation info, way to
      sort/filter addresses, or specific location info other than building number & street name <br><br>
      ↳ Mobile application has no dedicated dining/food related section <br><br>
      
      <img class="caseImage" src="/imagesAndIcons/NUGO/NUGO_AppAudit_.png"></img>

      <br><br>

      ↳ Website requires navigating to multiple pages in order to find vendor and money reload information <br><br>

      <span class="subsectionTitle">User Interviews | Identified Pain Points</span>
      <br><br>
      ↳ User didn’t know where they can use their card & which places took husky and/or dinning dollars <br><br>
      ↳ Users have to navigate through multiple websites in order to add money on to their card <br><br>
      ↳ Users never know when the swipe machine is down until they get to the register of an establishment

    <p class="sectionTitle">06 | REFLECTION</p>
    <p class="sectionCopy">Moving forward with this project, the next step would be to test the product against the
      current application and methods as well as address any UI issues.
      <br><br>
      This project was a good opportunity for conducting a design audit of the current
      product. Being able to examine the current process and solution really informed not only our user interviews
      but also out ideation process for developing out solution.

      <br><br><br>
      <span class="accentText">UPDATES, TESTING & MEASURING IMPACT</span><br><br>
      ↳ Standardize and correct the UI and design system to fix readability and visual accessability issues<br><br>
      ↳ Run task based user testing to see if the time it takes to complete tasks related to the pain points has reduced
      <br><br>
      ↳ Track student spending before and after implementing the updated section to look for an increase in
      spending<br><br>
      ↳ Track vendor profits and patrons to see if users are visiting vendors more and if they are spending husky
      dollars while there<br><br>
